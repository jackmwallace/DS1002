        "This assignment took about 20 minutes. I have experience with doing this sort of game, but I'm used to the Java bracket type structure for nesting if statements, so I had to adjust a bit for that. I don't think there's any way to break the game with the way it is, but maybe there is. It should take any input an only count up correct attempts. Only thing that I consulted the internet for was the \"isdigit()\" function because I couldn't remember what it was called in Python, everything else was from Professor Abram's lectures."
